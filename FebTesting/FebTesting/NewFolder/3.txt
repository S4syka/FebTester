Answer: Gumshoe research is simply doing what it takes to collect sufficient information to 
assess the target market feasibility of a product idea. A gumshoe is a detective or an investigator 
that scrounges around for information or clues wherever they can be found. This type of research
can take creative forms. For example, if your idea is to sell educational toys, you might spend a 
week volunteering at a day care center and watch how children interact with toys. Similarly, you 
might spend some time browsing through a toy store and observing the types of toys that get the 
most attention. Gumshoe research is simply being inventive in regard to the activities that can be 
undertaken to better understand your industry and target market's attractiveness.

48) Describe the purpose of industry/target market feasibility analysis, and identify the two 
primary issues that should be considered. What is the difference between a firm's industry and its
target market?
Answer: Industry/market feasibility analysis is an assessment of the overall appeal of the
industry and the target market for the product or service being promoted. For industry/target 
market feasibility analysis, there are two primary issues that a proposed business should 
consider: industry attractiveness and target market attractiveness. There is a distinct difference 
between a firm's industry and its target market. An industry is a group of firms producing a 
similar product or service, such as computers, cars, or electronic games. A firm's target market is 
the limited portion of the industry that it goes after or to which it wants to appeal. Most firms do 
not try to service their entire industry. Instead, they select or carve out a specific target market 
and try to service that market very well.1

75) Briefly describe the purpose of the First Screen and how it's used.
Answer: The First Screen is a template for completing a feasibility analysis. It is called First 
Screen because a feasibility analysis is an entrepreneur's initial pass at determining the feasibility
of a business idea. The mechanics for filling out the First Screen worksheet are straightforward. 
It maps the four areas of feasibility analysis accentuating the most important points in each area. 
The final section of the worksheet, "Overall Potential," includes a section that allows for 
suggested revisions of a business idea to improve its potential for feasibility. The value of the
First Screen is that it (1) provides an entrepreneur an overall sense of the feasibility of a business 
idea and (2) draws attention to issues that suggest the idea has low potential. The fact that an 
issue, such as total startup cash needed, is low potential does not necessarily mean that the 
business idea is not feasible. By drawing attention to this issue, an entrepreneur may think
through less expensive ways to launch the venture.
