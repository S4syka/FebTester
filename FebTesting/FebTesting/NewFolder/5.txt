Answer: Industry analysis is business research that focuses on the potential of an industry. An
industry is a group of firms producing a similar product, such as tires, fitness drinks, or 
electronic games. Once it is determined that a new venture is feasible in regard to the industry 
and market in which it will compete, a more in-depth analysis is needed to learn the ins and outs 
of the industry the firm plans to enter. This analysis helps a firm determine if the target market(s)
it identified during its feasibility analysis are accessible and which ones represent the best point 
of entry for a new firm.

analyzing these forces?
Answer: The five competitive forces that determine industry profitability are the threat of 
substitutes, the threat of new entrants, rivalry among existing firms, bargaining power of 
suppliers, and bargaining power of buyers. The five competitive forces model is a framework for 
understanding the structure of an industry and was developed by Harvard professor Michael 
Porter. Each of Porter's five forces impacts the average rate of return for the firms in an industry 
by applying pressure on industry profitability. Companies analyze the five forces to try to 
position their firms in a way that avoids or diminishes the negative impacts of these forces.

37) Discuss the nontraditional barriers to entry identified in the chapter. Why is it important that 
entrepreneurial firms utilize one or more of these forms of barriers to entry?
Answer: The nontraditional barriers to entry, which are particularly suitable for entrepreneurial 
firms, are strength of management team, first-mover advantage, passion of management team
and employees, unique business model, a unique Internet domain name, and inventing a new 
approach to an industry and executing the idea in an exemplary fashion. It is important that 
startups utilize one or more of these forms of barriers to entry because many of the traditional 
barriers to entry, like economies of scale, are expensive. It is difficult for startups to erect
expensive barriers to entry because money is usually tight.
