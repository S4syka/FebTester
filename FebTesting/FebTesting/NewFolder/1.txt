15) Describe the three primary reasons that people become entrepreneurs and start their own 
firms.
Answer: The three primary reasons that people become entrepreneurs and start their own firms 
are to (1) be their own boss, (2) pursue their own ideas, and (3) realize financial rewards.
The first of these reasons-being one's own boss-is given most commonly. Many entrepreneurs 
want to be their own boss because either they have had a long-time ambition to own their own 
firm or they have become frustrated working in traditional jobs. The second reason people start 
their own firms is to pursue their own ideas. Some people are naturally alert, and when they 
recognize ideas for new products or services, they have a desire to see those ideas realized. The
third reason people start their own firms is to pursue financial rewards. This motivation, 
however, is typically secondary to the first two.

31) Describe the four main characteristics of successful entrepreneurs.
Answer: The four main characteristics of successful entrepreneurs are: passion for the business, 
product/customer focus, tenacity despite failure, and execution intelligence. The number one 
characteristic shared by successful entrepreneurs is passion for their business, whether it is in the 
context of a new firm or an existing business. This passion typically stems from the 
entrepreneur's belief that the business will positively influence people's lives. A second defining 
characteristic of successful entrepreneurs is a product/customer focus. This characteristic 
underscores two of the most important elements in any business-products and customers. The 
third characteristic of successful entrepreneurs is tenacity despite failure. Because entrepreneurs 
are typically trying something new, the failure rate associated with their efforts is naturally high. 
The litmus test for entrepreneurs is their ability to persevere through setbacks and failures. The 
fourth characteristic of successful entrepreneurs is execution intelligence. The ability to 
effectively execute a business idea means developing a business model, putting together a new 
venture team, raising money, establishing partnerships, managing finances, leading and 
motivating employees, and so on.
