44) There is an emerging school of thought that opposes the idea of writing a business plan and 
advocates experimentation and trial-and-error learning gleaned through customer feedback and 
formal planning. How does the approach to writing a business plan described in this book differ 
from this philosophy? How does trial-and-error learning figure into the approach to writing a 
business plan advocated in this book?
Answer: This book takes the opposite approach, arguing that a business plan, proceeded by a 
feasibility analysis, represents an important starting point for a new venture and serves many 
useful purposes. In this sense, those developing a business plan should understand that it is not 
intended to be a static document written in isolation at a desk. Instead, it is anticipated that the 
research conducted to complete the plan, and the preceding feasibility analysis, will place the 
founders in touch with potential customers, suppliers, business partners, and others, and that the 
feedback obtained from these key players will cause the plan to change as it's being written.

71) What is an "executive summary?" Why is the executive summary often called the most 
important part of a business plan?
Answer: The executive summary is a short overview of the entire business plan; it provides a 
business plan reader with everything that needs to be known about a new venture's distinctive 
aspects. The executive summary is important because it is often the first (or only) part of a 
business plan that a busy investor or other stakeholders will read. As a result, unless the 
executive summary is compelling, the business plan may not get any additional attention.

72) Why is the "management team and company structure" section of the business plan often 
given disproportionate weight among investors?
Answer: Investors read more business plans with interesting ideas and exciting markets than 
they are able to finance. As a result, it's often not the idea or market that wins funding among 
competing plans, but the perception that one management team is better prepared to execute their
idea than the others.
