provides specific guidance to managers and employees regarding what is expected of them in 
terms of ethical behavior. (3) Implement an ethics training program. Firms also use ethics

14) What is a founders' agreement? Describe the purpose of a buyback clause and why it's 
important?
Answer: A founders' (or shareholders') agreement is a written document that deals with issues 
such as the relative split of the equity among the founders of the firm, how individual founders 
will be compensated for the cash or the "sweat equity" they put into the firm, and how long the 
founders will have to remain with the firm for their shares to fully vest. An important issue 
addressed by most founders' agreements is what happens to the equity of a founder if the founder
dies or decides to leave the firm. Most founders' agreements include a buyback clause, which 
legally obligates the departing founders to sell to the remaining founders their interest in the firm
if the remaining founders are interested. In most cases, the agreement also specifies the formula 
for computing the dollar value to be paid. The presence of a buyback agreement is important for 
at least two reasons. First, if a founder leaves the firm, the remaining founders may need the 
shares to offer to a replacement person. Second, if founders leave because they are disgruntled, 
the buyback clause provides the remaining founders a mechanism to keep the shares of the firm 
in the hands of people who are fully committed to a positive future for the venture.

15) Describe the purpose of a nondisclosure agreement. Provide an example of when a 
nondisclosure agreement kicks in.
Answer: A nondisclosure agreement is a promise made by an employee or other party (e.g., a 
supplier) to not disclose the company's trade secrets. An example would be an employee who is 
privy to a company's marketing strategy. If the employee quit her job and went to work for a 
competitor, it would be a violation of her nondisclosure agreement to tell her new employer the 
details of her previous employer's marketing strategy.

74) Describe what is meant by a "general partnership" and a "limited partnership." Describe the 
major difference between the two.
Answer: A general partnership is a form of business organization where two or more people pool
their skills, abilities, and resources to run a business. A limited partnership is a modified form of 
a general partnership. The major difference between the two is that a limited partnership includes
two classes of owners: general partners and limited partners. Similar to a general partnership, the
general partners are liable for the debts and obligations of the partnership, but the limited 
partners are liable only up to the amount of their investment.

75) What is meant by the term "piercing the corporate veil"? How can the corporate veil be 
pierced?
Answer: In most states, corporations must file papers annually, to maintain their status as a 
corporation and to comply with state regulations. It is important that a corporation's owners fully 
comply with these regulations. If the owners of a corporation don't file their annual paperwork, 
neglect to pay their annual fees, or commit fraud, a court could ignore the fact that a corporation 
has been established, and the owners could be held personally liable for actions of the 
corporation. This chain of events is referred to as "piercing the corporate veil."
