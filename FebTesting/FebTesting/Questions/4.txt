8) What is a business model? Why is it important? Provide an example to illustrate your answer.
Answer: A business model is a firm's plan or recipe for how it creates, delivers, and captures 
value for its stakeholders. Business models are fundamental to a firm's ability to succeed both in 
the short and long term. Dropbox, for example, has what's referred to as a freemium business 
model. It offers customers a free account with a set amount of storage space, and makes money 
by selling premium accounts with more capacity. Dropbox could charge all of its users a monthly
fee based on the amount of storage that they use, but that's not its business model. Its business 
model is based on the belief that by introducing users to its service through a free account, it will
ultimately sign up more paid users. A firm's business model also describes how the core aspects 
of what it does fit together and complement one another.

26) What is the difference between standard business models and disruptive business models? 
Include examples of both in your answer.
Answer: Standard business models depict existing plans or recipes firms can use to determine 
how they will create, deliver, and capture value for their stakeholders. Examples include the
advertising business model, the auction business model, the low-cost business model, and the 
manufacture/retailer business model. Disruptive business models, which are rare, are ones that 
do not fit the profile of a standard business model, and are impactful enough that they disrupt or 
change the way business is conducted in an industry or an important niche within an industry. 
Examples include Dell (which introduced the direct-to-consumer computer sales model), Google
(which introduced the online advertising model), and Salesforce.com (which introduced the 
notion of software as a service, or SaaS).

73) Describe the Barringer/Ireland Business Model Template and discuss its purpose.
Answer: The Barringer/Ireland Business Model Template is a visual template that lays out the 
four major categories and 12 individual parts of a firm's business model. The job of the 
entrepreneur, or team of entrepreneurs, is to configure their firm's business model in a manner 
that produces a viable and exciting business. The Barringer/Ireland Business Model template is a 
tool that allows an entrepreneur to describe, project, revise, and pivot a business model until all 
12 parts are decided upon. The 12 parts are spread out, which provides space for ideas to be 
recorded, scratched out, and recorded again as ideas morph and change. The four major 
categories and 12 individual parts are: Core Strategy (business mission, basis of differentiation, 
target market, and product/market scope), Resources (core competency and key assets), 
Financials (revenue streams, cost structure, and financing/funding), and Operations (product or 
service production, channels, and key partners).

integral to a firm's overall business model and represent the day-to-day heartbeat of a firm. The 
primary elements of operations are: product or service production, channels, and key partners.
