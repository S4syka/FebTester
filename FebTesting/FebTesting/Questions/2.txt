14) Describe the difference between an idea and an opportunity. Why is the distinction 
important?
Answer: An opportunity is a favorable set of circumstances that creates a need for a new 
product, service, or business. An opportunity has four essential qualities. It is (1) attractive, (2) 
durable, (3) timely, and (4) is anchored in a product, service, or business that creates or adds 
value for its buyer or end user. In contrast, an idea is a thought, impression, or notion. It may or 
may not meet the criteria of an opportunity. This distinction between an idea and an opportunity 
is important because many entrepreneurial ventures fail not because the entrepreneurs that 
launched them didn't work hard, but rather because there was no real opportunity to begin with.

33) Describe the three separate ways that entrepreneurs identify new business, product, and 
service opportunities?
Answer: The three ways that entrepreneurs identify new business, product, and service 
opportunities are through observing trends, solving a problem, and finding gaps in the 
marketplace. The first approach to identifying opportunities is to observe trends and study how 
they create opportunities to pursue. Economic forces, social factors, technological advances, and 
political action and regulatory changes are the most important trends to follow. The second 
approach to identifying opportunities is solving a problem. Sometimes identifying opportunities 
simply involves noticing a problem and finding a way to solve it. These problems can be 
pinpointed through observing trends and through more simple means (e.g., intuition, serendipity, 
or chance). The third approach is finding gaps in the marketplace. This approach is accomplished
by finding a need that customers have that is not being satisfied-by either large, established firms
or entrepreneurial ventures. Large retailers like Wal-Mart, Costco, and Home Depot compete
primarily on price by serving large groups of customers with similar needs. They do this by 
offering the most popular items targeted towards mainstream consumers. While this approach 
allows the large retailers to achieve economies of scale, it leaves gaps in the marketplace. 
Entrepreneurs step in to start businesses to fill these gaps. There are also gaps in the marketplace 
that represent consumer needs that aren't being met by anyone.

59) Describe the difference between strong-tie and weak-tie relationships. Is it more likely that 
an entrepreneur will get new ideas through strong-tie or weak-tie relationships?
Answer: Strong-tie relationships are characterized by frequent interaction and form between 
coworkers, friends, and spouses. Weak-tie relationships are characterized by infrequent 
interaction and form between casual acquaintances. According to research in this area, it is more 
likely that an entrepreneur will get a new business idea through a weak-tie than a strong-tie 
relationship because strong-tie relationships, which typically form between like-minded 
individuals, tend to reinforce insights and ideas the individuals already have. Weak-tie 
relationships, on the other hand, which form between casual acquaintances, are not as apt to be 
between like-minded individuals, so one person may say something to another that sparks a 
completely new idea.

70) Describe how brainstorming can help facilitate the generation of ideas, and outline the four 
rules for conducting a brainstorming session.
Answer: Brainstorming is a technique that is used to generate a number of ideas quickly. Among
the purposes a brainstorming session could be used for include the generation of new business, 
product, or service ideas. In a brainstorming session, the leader of the group of people is 
instructed to come up with ideas-one person shares an idea, another person reacts to it, another 
person reacts to the reaction, and so on. A flip chart is typically used to record all the ideas. A 
productive session is freewheeling and lively. The main objective is to create an atmosphere of 
enthusiasm and originality where lots of ideas are generated. The four strict rules of 
brainstorming are as follows:
1. No criticism is allowed.
2. Freewheeling is encouraged—the more ideas, the better.
3. The session moves quickly, and nothing is permitted to slow down the pace.
4. Leapfrogging is encouraged. This means using one idea as a means of jumping forward 
quickly to other ideas.

71) Describe how library and Internet research can be used to generate new business ideas.
Answer: Library and Internet research are important tools for generating business ideas. A 
natural tendency is to think that an idea should be chosen, the process of researching the idea 
should then begin. This approach is too linear. Often, the best ideas emerge when the general 
notion of an idea, like creating casual electronic games for adults, is merged with extensive 
library and Internet research, which might provide insights into the best types of casual games to 
create. The best approach to utilizing a library is to discuss your general area of interest with a 
reference librarian, who can point you to useful resources, such as industry-specific magazines, 
trade journals, and industry reports. Simply browsing through several issues of a trade journal 
can spark new ideas. Internet research is also important. If you are starting from scratch, simply 
typing "new business ideas" into Google or Yahoo! will produce links to newspaper and 
magazine articles about the "hottest" and "latest" new business ideas. If you have a specific idea 
in mind, a useful technique is to set up a Google e-mail alert using keywords that pertain to your 
topic of interest The Internet can also be used for specific searches and to access blogs that
provide insightful information on almost any topic.
